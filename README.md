Liero Clone
===========

This is a sort of clone of the 1999 game Liero. I built this as a way to
teach myself game development. It is not finished, but I doubt I will finish
it. It's functional, but missing a lot of features.

* Destructible map
* Mouse aiming
* Grapple
* AI (can barely call it intelligent though)
* 4 different weapons
